# Tutorial

## 1. Installation

To install it, just press "]" in julia REPL and type

```
pkg> add https://github.com/Asmendeus/iMPSForClassicalModels.jl.git#main
```

## 2. Model

## 3. Solving fixed point eqaution

## 4. Observables

## 5. For quantum systems

In fact, `iMPSForClassicalModels.jl` can also be used to solve the ground state of a quantum model by the imaginary time evolution method, where MPO is the projection operator of a single imaginary time slice. However, the package does not support controlling global quantum numbers, although it allows adding local symmetry. The package `InfiniteMPS.jl` for quantum systems are being rapidly developed.
